# SOLUTION: localhost:3000 Access Issue

## ‚ùå **WHY localhost:3000 DOESN'T WORK**

The error occurs because:
1. **Node.js is NOT installed** on this system
2. **No development server is running** at localhost:3000
3. **React applications require a server** to run at localhost URLs

## ‚úÖ **WORKING SOLUTIONS**

### **SOLUTION 1: Use the Standalone Demo (Immediate)**
The standalone demo works WITHOUT Node.js:

**Method A: File Explorer**
1. Open Windows File Explorer
2. Navigate to: `C:\Users\e729958\Documents\AI readiness check`
3. Double-click `standalone-demo.html`
4. It will open in your default browser

**Method B: Browser Direct**
1. Open any web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge)
2. Press `Ctrl + O` (File ‚Üí Open)
3. Navigate to and select `standalone-demo.html`
4. Click Open

**Method C: Drag & Drop**
1. Open your web browser
2. Drag `standalone-demo.html` from File Explorer into the browser window

### **SOLUTION 2: Install Node.js for Full Development (Recommended for Production)**

**Step 1: Install Node.js**
1. Go to https://nodejs.org
2. Download the LTS version (Long Term Support)
3. Run the installer and follow the setup wizard
4. Restart your computer

**Step 2: Start the Development Server**
```bash
# Open Command Prompt or PowerShell in the project folder
cd "C:\Users\e729958\Documents\AI readiness check"
npm install
npm start
```

**Step 3: Access the Application**
- The development server will start automatically
- Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser
- The full React application will be available

### **SOLUTION 3: Alternative Local Server (If Node.js installation is not possible)**

**Using Python (if available):**
```bash
# In the project folder
python -m http.server 8000
# Then access: http://localhost:8000/standalone-demo.html
```

**Using Live Server Extension in VS Code:**
1. Install "Live Server" extension in VS Code
2. Right-click on `standalone-demo.html`
3. Select "Open with Live Server"

## üéØ **RECOMMENDED IMMEDIATE ACTION**

**For Testing Right Now:**
1. Open File Explorer
2. Navigate to the project folder
3. Double-click `standalone-demo.html`
4. The application will open and work perfectly

**For Production Development:**
1. Install Node.js from nodejs.org
2. Run `npm install` and `npm start`
3. Access the full application at localhost:3000
